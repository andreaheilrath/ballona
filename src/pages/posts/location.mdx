## Location

The Ballona Wetlands Ecological Reserve ("Buy-yo-nah") is a protected area in Los Angeles County, California, just south of Marina del Rey. 
This 577-acre (2.34 km²) site used to be the natural estuary for Ballona Creek. 
It is the second-largest open space within Los Angeles city limits, after Griffith Park, and is owned by the state of California and managed by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. 
The reserve is divided east-west by the Ballona Creek channel and bordered by the 90 Marina Freeway to the east.

Originally, the Ballona Wetlands covered between 6.1 km² and 8.5 km². 
Today, the wetlands are divided into five distinct ecological areas: 
saltwater marsh (fed by the ocean), freshwater marsh (fed by creeks and streams), riparian corridor (creek bottomland), sand dunes, and bluffs.

Simply put, Ballona is a remnant of Los Angeles' once extensive wetland landscapes. 
Despite its degraded state, Ballona is valuable to many creatures. 
It is a marsh, a wasteland, a toxic site, a cherished area, and a battleground for environmentalists. 
This piece of "highly degraded" nature has endured despite being filled in, grazed, dumped on, fought over, and surrounded by concrete, levees, pipelines, and wells.

Ballona Creek flows into the Pacific Ocean about a mile south of the Venice Beach fishing pier, but the coastline is interrupted by the Marina del Rey harbor. 
The wetlands are also crossed by major roads, and the Ballona Bluffs, with their trails and creek, are now separated from the wetlands by the Playa Vista development. 
To the south, the Hyperion Sewage Treatment Plant and Los Angeles International Airport dominate the coastal landscape.
