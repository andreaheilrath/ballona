## Restoration

The "Restorying Ballona" project focuses on the concept of “ecological restor(y)ation,” which integrates ecological restoration with storytelling to address the complexities of restoring the Ballona Wetlands in Los Angeles. This approach emphasizes the intertwined nature of ecological and cultural narratives in restoration efforts.

The project highlights the controversies and challenges involved in the restoration process, particularly the need to balance diverse habitat needs for both human and non-human species. It underscores the importance of ecological resilience and sustainable urban environmentalism.

"Restorying Ballona" is part of a broader exploration of urban nature, comparing the Ballona Wetlands restoration with other renaturalization projects worldwide. This comparison aims to provide insights into effective strategies for rebalancing nature in metropolitan areas, fostering a deeper understanding of urban environmentalism.
