## Wildlife

The Ballona Wetlands support a range of habitats, including coastal prairie, willow woodland, and both saltwater and freshwater marshes. 
These diverse environments are crucial for many species, providing nurseries for fish, habitats for birds, and natural water filtration systems.

Wetland plants such as pickleweed and alkali heath thrive in these areas, while various introduced species also make their home here. 
The wetlands are particularly significant as a stopover on the Pacific Flyway, supporting over 250 bird species during migration.

Additionally, the wetlands offer important ecological services, including flood protection and groundwater replenishment.
This natural infrastructure helps mitigate the impacts of urban development in the surrounding areas.

Efforts to preserve and restore the Ballona Wetlands are ongoing, aiming to enhance these vital ecosystems and maintain the biodiversity they support. 
These initiatives are critical in ensuring the wetlands continue to provide their valuable ecological functions.
